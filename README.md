# ECE 372 Lab 2
Authors: Rachel & Ali

The objective is to learn how to use loops and memory access in assembly language. 
By the end of the lab, students should have gained more knowledge of memory access, loops, terminal I/O,
and flowcharts.

This lab was built in three phases. Each phase was built on top of the previous phase, resulting in 
one final version of the program.

The final version of the program is designed to print the contents of 20 successive memory locations
with a preceding decimal counter and ":" character. The counter will start at zero, but increment after
each output. There must also be a space between each result, and the program only outputs the 
next memory contents when the spacebar is pressed by the user.

e.g. The output on screen should be similar to this:
00:1D
01:0B
02:13
......
18:A4
19:0A
